Inputs:
- center_id
- teacher_id
- date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- start_at, end_at (DATETIME)
- ignore_rule_id (optional)

Steps:

   - start_at < end_at
2) Check personal sessions overlap:
   - select sessions where teacher_id=? and start_at < end_at AND end_at > start_at
3) Check center rules overlap for that date:
   - weekday(date)
   - select rules where center_id=? and teacher_id=? and weekday=? (exclude ignore_rule_id)
   - project rule time to date then overlap check
4) If conflicts -> return TIME_CONFLICT(31101) with conflict list
5) else return ok=true

Overlap:
(aStart < bEnd) && (bStart < aEnd)

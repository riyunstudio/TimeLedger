# Continuous Learning v2 - Instinct-Based Architecture

An advanced learning system that turns your Claude Code sessions into reusable knowledge through atomic "instincts" - small learned behaviors with confidence scoring.

## What's New in v2

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Observation | Stop hook (session end) | PreToolUse/PostToolUse (100% reliable) |
| Analysis | Main context | Background agent (Haiku) |
| Granularity | Full skills | Atomic "instincts" |
| Confidence | None | 0.3-0.9 weighted |
| Evolution | Direct to skill | Instincts → cluster → skill/command/agent |
| Sharing | None | Export/import instincts |

## The Instinct Model

An instinct is a small learned behavior:

```yaml
---
id: prefer-functional-style
trigger: "when writing new functions"
confidence: 0.7
domain: "code-style"
source: "session-observation"
---

# Prefer Functional Style

## Action
Use functional patterns over classes when appropriate.

## Evidence
- Observed 5 instances of functional pattern preference
- User corrected class-based approach to functional on 2025-01-15
```

**Properties:**
- **Atomic** — one trigger, one action
- **Confidence-weighted** — 0.3 = tentative, 0.9 = near certain
- **Domain-tagged** — code-style, testing, git, debugging, workflow, etc.
- **Evidence-backed** — tracks what observations created it

## Quick Start for Cursor

### 1. Initialize Instincts

Run this command in your terminal to view the status (this will also create the necessary directories in `.cursor/homunculus`):

```bash
python .cursor/scripts/instinct-cli.py status
```

### 2. Available Commands

You can use the `instinct-cli.py` script to manage your instincts directly:

- **Check Status**:
  ```bash
  python .cursor/scripts/instinct-cli.py status
  ```

- **Import Instincts**:
  ```bash
  python .cursor/scripts/instinct-cli.py import <file_or_url>
  ```

- **Export Instincts**:
  ```bash
  python .cursor/scripts/instinct-cli.py export --output my-instincts.yaml
  ```

- **Evolve (Analyze Patterns)**:
  ```bash
  python .cursor/scripts/instinct-cli.py evolve
  ```

## Note on Automation

In Cursor, the extensive "background observation" hooks from Claude Code are not natively supported out of the box. However, you can manually run these commands or ask Cursor to "check my instincts" to retrieve relevant patterns.

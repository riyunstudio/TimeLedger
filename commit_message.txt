refactor(frontend): reorganize components into feature directories

- Admin/: 26 management-related components (headers, sidebars, tabs, modals)
- Teacher/: 11 teacher-related components (profile, skills, schedules)
- Navigation/: 1 navigation component (notification dropdown)
- Scheduling/: 18 scheduling components (calendars, grids, modals)
- Base/: 14 base UI components (buttons, inputs, loading, toasts)

All Nuxt auto-imports preserved as subdirectory components can be imported using their filename without the directory prefix.
